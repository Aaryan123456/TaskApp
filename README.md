# Task App
Its just a app to list all your task in a place in case if you ever forget one you can just open the app and see your tasks.

How to use the app:
Write a task down in the "Write The Task" space and click add to add that specific task.
You can remove a task just by clicking on a that task.

For Example:
If I add a task named feed the dog or complete your assignment and I have completed that task then I will click on the task to remove it from the app.

Thank you
